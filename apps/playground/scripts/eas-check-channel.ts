/**
 * Fails unless the EAS Update channel has at least one branch pointed at it.
 *
 * A channel is created by the first build that names it and is never linked to a
 * branch by `eas update`, so a workflow can publish every update to the
 * `production` branch while every `production` binary asks the server for a
 * channel with nothing behind it. That is what happened to TestFlight build 5 on
 * 2026-09-22: the padding fix was live on the branch and unreachable from the app
 * until `eas channel:edit production --branch production` was run by hand.
 *
 * Usage: bun scripts/eas-check-channel.ts [channel]   (default: production)
