# native-ui — Shared React Native Components

A standalone React Native component library. Styling is Uniwind (Tailwind v4 for
React Native); interaction is Reanimated + Gesture Handler; haptics are Pulsar.

This library has no relationship to, and takes no dependency on, any third-party
React Native component kit. Do not add one, and do not port patterns from one.

## Stack

- **Uniwind** — Tailwind v4 for React Native (`className` on RN components)
- **tailwind-variants** (`tv`) — variant systems
- **react-native-reanimated** — UI-thread animation
- **react-native-gesture-handler** — the Gesture API
- **react-native-pulsar** — worklet-callable haptics
- **Central Icons** — the icon set (never Lucide, Hugeicons, or anything else)

## Commands

```bash
bun run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
bun run check              # Biome lint + format
bun test                   # unit tests (pure logic only — see Testing)
bun run gen-exports        # regenerate package.json exports
```

## Directory structure

One component per folder. The folder's `index.ts` is that component's public
entry point, and the folder name is its export subpath.

```

```

Everything belonging to a component — sub-components, variants, tests, local
hooks, helpers — lives in its folder and is re-exported from that `index.ts`.
Nothing outside reaches past the index into a component's internals.

## The three component patterns

**A — Styled wrapper.** A component with no state that maps props to classes.
Example: `Icon`, which also reads `IconDefaultsProvider` so a parent can set
size and colour for its whole subtree instead of every call site repeating them.

**B — Compound + context.** A root that shares `variant`/`size`/`isDisabled`
through context with dot-notation sub-components, plus a `useX()` hook so a
custom child can match the parent without prop drilling. Example: `Button` with
`Button.Label`, `Button.StartContent`, `Button.EndContent` and `useButton()`.
Reach for this over adding boolean props.

**C — `tv()` variants.** Size and variant axes defined in a `*.variants.ts`
sibling, never inline in the component. Example: `button.variants.ts`.

## Rules

1. **Text colour goes on the `Text`, never the parent.** A React Native `View`
   does not cascade colour to a `Text` descendant the way a DOM element does.
   `buttonLabelVariants` owns `text-*`; `buttonVariants` must not.
2. **No `"use client"`.** That is an RSC directive; it means nothing here.
3. **No package-wide barrel.** Import from the subpath:
   `@delacour/native-ui/button`. This is what lets an app skip resolving
   optional peers it never uses. A component folder's own `index.ts` is its
   entry point, not a barrel — never add a top-level `src/index.ts`.
4. **Run `bun run gen-exports`** after adding or removing a component folder or
   a file under `src/hooks`, `src/lib`, or `src/icons`. Never hand-edit the
   `exports` map. A component folder without an `index.ts` fails the script.
5. **Central Icons only**, via `@delacour/native-ui/icons/central`.
6. **Never wrap a React Native or Reanimated component with `withUniwind`.**
   `View`, `Text`, `Pressable`, `Animated.View` and friends already accept
   `className`. `withUniwind` is only for third-party components (`expo-image`,
   `expo-blur`), and a given component may only be wrapped once, in one file.
7. **Native modules are peer dependencies, never dependencies.** Two copies of
   a native module register twice and break at runtime.
8. **`cn()` for every caller-supplied `className`.** Uniwind does not
   deduplicate conflicting utilities on its own.
9. **No `any`.** Discriminated unions over loose types.
10. **Token names diverge from the web package where the mobile kit needs
    them to.** This package uses `danger` / `danger-soft` (matching the button
    variant names) and adds `tertiary`, where the web package uses
    `destructive`. `X-foreground` always means "content drawn on an `X`
    surface" — keep that meaning when adding a token.

## Button

The reference implementation for the patterns above.

- **Variants**: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, `outline`, `ghost`,
  `danger`, `danger-soft`. **Sizes**: `sm`, `md`, `lg`.
- **Icons are composed, never passed as props.** Put an `Icon` in the children,
  before or after the label. The button wraps its subtree in an
  `IconDefaultsProvider` carrying `BUTTON_ICON_SIZE[size]` and
  `BUTTON_FOREGROUND_TOKEN[variant]`, so a bare `<Icon icon={IconPlus} />`
  comes out the right size and colour with nothing said at the call site. An
  explicit `size` or `color` on the icon still wins. `Button.StartContent` /
  `Button.EndContent` remain for wrapping non-icon content.
- **`isIconOnly`** gives a square footprint. Always pair it with an
  `accessibilityLabel`; there is no text for a screen reader to fall back on.
- **String children** are wrapped in a `Button.Label` automatically. React
  Native crashes on bare text outside a `<Text>`, so never render a raw string
  in a component that accepts free-form children without doing the same. Note
  that *consecutive* strings collapse into one label — `Row {i}` is a single
  piece of text, and wrapping each part separately would space them apart by
  the button's own `gap`.
- **`feedback`**: `scale` (default) or `none`. Press feedback is the spring
  scale and nothing else. **Do not add ripple, ink, glow or highlight overlays**
  — no wash layers on pressables in this library.

## Theming

Tokens are CSS variables under `@variant light` / `@variant dark` in
`src/styles/theme.css`. Components reference semantic names — `bg-background`,
`text-muted-foreground` — and never a raw palette colour or a `dark:` prefix;
the variable swap handles the theme. For a prop that needs a colour *value*
rather than a class (an icon's `color`, a gradient stop), use `useThemeColor`.

## Testing

`bun test` covers **pure logic only**: `cn`, `mergeProps`, `composeRefs`, and
the `tv()` variant functions. It cannot render components — React Native ships
Flow-typed source that Bun's transpiler cannot parse, and
`@testing-library/react-native` needs a Jest transform. This is why variant
definitions live in `*.variants.ts` files free of React Native imports.

Rendering is verified in `apps/playground` on a simulator. If render tests
become necessary, add `jest-expo` to the playground rather than to this package.

## Adding a component

1. `src/components/{name}/{name}.tsx`, plus `{name}.variants.ts` if it has
   variants, plus an `index.ts` re-exporting the component and its types.
2. Build interaction on `Pressable` — never on a bare `TouchableOpacity`.
3. Write the variant tests first; they are the part `bun test` can reach.
4. `bun run gen-exports`.
5. Render it in `apps/playground/src/app/index.tsx` and check it on a simulator.

## Consuming from an app

```css
/* app global.css — use the real workspace path, not a node_modules path:
   Bun symlinks workspace packages and Tailwind's scanner cannot follow
   symlinks, so classes would be silently dropped from production builds. */
@import '@delacour/native-ui/styles';
@source '../../../../packages/native-ui/src';
```

```tsx
import { Button } from "@delacour/native-ui/button";
import { Icon } from "@delacour/native-ui/icon";
import { IconArrowRight } from "@delacour/native-ui/icons/central";

// The icon inherits the button's size and its variant's colour.
<Button haptic="selection" onPress={next}>
  <Button.Label>Continue</Button.Label>
  <Icon icon={IconArrowRight} />
</Button>;

<Button accessibilityLabel="Favourite" isIconOnly variant="ghost">
  <Icon icon={IconHeart} />
</Button>;
```

The package ships raw `.tsx`; there is no build step. Uniwind's transform runs
in the consuming app's Metro pipeline, so a precompiled build would arrive after
that transform with its classNames already dead.
