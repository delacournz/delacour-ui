 * *Is* a `Text.Paragraph`, defaulting to the muted token — the title is what the
 * sheet is about and this is what it means, so the two need to read as a
 * hierarchy rather than as two equal lines. `color` is an ordinary prop, so a
 * description that needs the page colour asks for it.
 *
 * It has no slot in `bottomSheetVariants`, and that is deliberate: it carries no
 * layout of its own, and `tv` emits `undefined` for an empty class string, so a
 * slot here would be one nothing could assert against.
 *
 * @example
 * <BottomSheet.Description>Update to the latest version.</BottomSheet.Description>
