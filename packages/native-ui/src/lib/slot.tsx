/**
 * Renders its props into its single child instead of emitting an element.
 *
 * This is what backs the `asChild` prop: `<Pressable asChild><Button /></Pressable>`
 * gives the Button the Pressable's behaviour with no extra View in the tree.
 * Props are combined by {@link mergeProps} and refs by {@link composeRefs}.
 *
 * React 19 exposes `ref` as an ordinary prop, so no `forwardRef` is involved.
 *
 * Do not pass a Reanimated style through this. React Native deep freezes style
 * props on a non-animated component in development, and Reanimated's effect
 * then throws trying to write to the frozen object. `Pressable` handles that
 * case by rendering the child through an animated counterpart of its own type.
