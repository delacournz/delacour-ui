 * Three things happen here and nowhere else in the skin:
 *
 * - **`bottomInset` defaults to the safe-area bottom**, read from
 *   `useSafeAreaInsets()`. The engine reserves that band under the body or the
 *   sticky footer and gives it back to the keyboard as it arrives; a caller
 *   never pads for the home indicator by hand.
 * - **The haptics are on by default.** Pass `onSnapPointHaptic={undefined}` to
 *   turn one off, or a worklet of your own to change it.
 * - **The stale-keyboard guard runs on mount.** A sheet mounted while
 *   `KeyboardProvider`'s shared values are pinned open by a keyboard that
 *   vanished without a `will` event would lift for a keyboard that is not
 *   there; `Screen.Footer` runs the same repair for the same reason.
 *
 * `topInset` is left at the engine's zero, so a `%` snap point is a fraction of the
 * whole window — the same fraction it was before this rewrite.

/**
 * A panel that slides up from the bottom of the screen, over everything.
 *
 * A thin Uniwind skin over `@delacour/react-native-bottom-sheet`: every part
 * here is the engine's part with this library's classes, `Text` presets and
 * `Pressable` on it. The engine owns the state, the geometry, the gestures,
 * the keyboard, the portal and the accessibility; this file owns what it looks
 * like.
 *
 * **The app mounts `BottomSheetProvider` once**, inside `DelacourProvider` and
 * around its navigator. `DelacourProvider` cannot do it — the engine is an
 * optional peer of this library — so the provider is exported from this
 * subpath for the app to place. Without it a `Portal` renders where it is
 * written, which is the inline sheet.
 *
 * Controlled or not, from one hook: pass `isOpen` and `onOpenChange` to own the
 * state, or nothing at all and let the sheet hold it.
 *
 * @example
 * <BottomSheet>
 *   <BottomSheet.Trigger asChild>
 *     <Button variant="secondary">Open</Button>
 *   </BottomSheet.Trigger>
 *   <BottomSheet.Portal>
 *     <BottomSheet.Overlay />
 *     <BottomSheet.Container>
 *       <BottomSheet.Content>
 *         <BottomSheet.Close />
 *         <BottomSheet.Title>Keep yourself safe</BottomSheet.Title>
 *         <BottomSheet.Description>Update to the latest version.</BottomSheet.Description>
 *       </BottomSheet.Content>
 *       <BottomSheet.Footer sticky>
 *         <Button onPress={update}>Update now</Button>
 *       </BottomSheet.Footer>
 *     </BottomSheet.Container>
 *   </BottomSheet.Portal>
 * </BottomSheet>
 *
 * @example
 * // Controlled, snapped, and scrolling.
 * <BottomSheet dynamicSizing={false} isOpen={isOpen} onOpenChange={setOpen} snapPoints={["50%", "90%"]}>
 *   <BottomSheet.Portal>
 *     <BottomSheet.Overlay />
 *     <BottomSheet.Container>
 *       <BottomSheet.ScrollView>{rows}</BottomSheet.ScrollView>
 *     </BottomSheet.Container>
